# Custom C++ Memory-Manager-Made-Easy
This Repository basically contains the explained code of the IBM C++Memory Made Easy Custom Memory Manager
This is a useful mini Computer Science Project.

We have added comments on each point of the Code.Feel free to ask questions or contribute

Also Custom contains the custom memory manager code thoroughly explained.
Default is the program which uses the default C++ memory management.

In I-5 Processors (8 GB RAM) 
Each iteration of the outermost loop causes 1000 allocations and deallocations. 5000 such iterations result in 10 million switches between user and kernel code. Compiling this test on a gcc  in an Intel I5 machine took an average of 0.168477 seconds.Our Custom Memory Manager Takes 0.105 seconds roughly 25% improvement in Time which is a drastic change.
